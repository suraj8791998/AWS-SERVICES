# AWS Lambda:

# Step 1: Access Lambda
    Definition: AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

    Instructions:

         Go to the AWS Management Console.

         In the navigation pane, choose "Lambda."

# Step 2: Create a Lambda Function
    Definition: A Lambda function is a piece of code that you can run in response to events.

    Instructions:

         Click the "Create function" button.

         Choose the authoring method (Author from scratch, Blueprints, or Layers).

         Configure your function by specifying the runtime, permissions, and triggers.

# Step 3: Configure Triggers
    Definition: Lambda functions can be triggered by various events, such as API Gateway, S3 uploads, 
         CloudWatch Alarms, and more.

    Instructions:

          Add triggers to your Lambda function to specify the events that trigger its execution.

          Configure trigger-specific settings, such as event source mapping or input parameters.

# Step 4: Write and Upload Code
   Definition: Write the code that your Lambda function will execute.

   Instructions:

          In the Lambda function configuration, scroll down to the function code section.

          Write or upload your code using the Lambda console's built-in code editor or by uploading a .zip or .jar file.

          Test your code in the console to ensure it works as expected.

# Step 5: Set Function Execution Role
    Definition: Lambda functions require an execution role that defines what AWS resources the function can access.

    Instructions:

          Create a new execution role or use an existing one.

          Specify permissions and resource access for the function using IAM policies.

# Step 6: Configure Function Settings
    Definition: Define various settings for your Lambda function, such as memory, timeout, and environment variables.

    Instructions:

           Set the allocated memory for your function (which impacts CPU and network performance).   
 
           Define the maximum execution timeout.Configure environment variables if your function requires them.

# Step 7: Monitor and Troubleshoot
    Definition: Monitor the execution and performance of your Lambda functions.

    Instructions:

           Access CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to track the function's execution and troubleshoot any issues.

           Use X-Ray for tracing and analyzing the function's performance.

# Step 8: Versioning and Alias (Optional)
    Definition: You can create function versions and aliases to manage different versions of your function code.

    Instructions:

           Create versions of your function as you make updates.

           Define aliases that point to specific function versions for routing traffic.

# Step 9: Cleanup and Removal (Optional)
    Definition: If you no longer need a Lambda function, you can delete it to avoid incurring charges.

    Instructions:In the Lambda console, select the function and choose "Delete function."
