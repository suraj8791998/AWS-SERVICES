    Instructions:
    
        Configure network settings, such as the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnet.
        
        Specify user data scripts to run during instance launch.

# Step 4: Add Storage
    Definition: Attach storage volumes (EBS - Elastic Block Store) to your EC2 instance to store data.
    
    Instructions:
    
         Configure the root volume (OS drive) and add additional volumes if needed.Set storage type (e.g., SSD or HDD) and size.

# Step 5: Add Tags

    Instructions:
    
         Add tags with meaningful names, such as "Environment," "Application," or "Owner."

# Step 6: Configure Security Groups
    Definition: Security Groups are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances.
    
    Instructions:
    
            Select an existing Security Group or create a new one.
            
            Define inbound and outbound rules for the Security Group.

# Step 7: Review and Launch
    Definition: Review the configuration of your instance before launching it.
    
    Instructions:
    
       Review instance details, storage, security, and other settings.
       
       Click the "Launch" button when you're ready to start the instance.

# Step 8: Create or Select a Key Pair
    Definition: A key pair is required for securely accessing your EC2 instance using SSH or RDP.
    
    Instructions:
    
       Create a new key pair or select an existing one.
       
       Download and save the private key for connecting to your instance.

# Step 9: Connect to Your Instance
    Definition: After launching your instance, you can connect to it using SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows).
    
    Instructions:
    
        Use your private key to connect securely to your Linux instance or use the provided password for Windows instances.

# Step 10: Manage and Monitor Instances
    Definition: Monitor and manage your instances using the EC2 Dashboard and other AWS services like CloudWatch.
    
    Instructions:Access the EC2 Dashboard to view information about your instances, manage them, and stop or terminate 
    
    instances when they're no longer needed.
